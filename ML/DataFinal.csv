This study using social perspectives is useful to explain why voters were not present at polling stations during the Medan 2018 Election. It elaborates the social aspects that influenced non-voting behavior in the urban area of Medan in North Sumatra, Indonesia during the 2018 gubernatorial election. Utilizing mix- method strategies, instead of citing social aspects as a mere research context, this article argues that social aspects in the form of social cleavages worked behind the silent apathy, namely apathy that was implicitly indicated by voters who were not present at polling stations. Social cleavages including ethnicity, religion and gender indicated a paradox since they—with the exception of gender—were used by candidates as the main campaign substance. On the other hand, large numbers of people showed disinterest in these social cleavages during the election.

The research is vital for expanding the literature about maintaining the unemployment rate amid crisis, ultimately reducing unnecessary social costs. The quantitative approach in this study uses a Granger causality test to understand the effect of the shock caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on unemployment. Meanwhile, the qualitative approach in this study uses literature related to economic growth, crisis management, and unemployment. Granger causality tests show that economic slowdown hurts the unemployment rate. Based on discussion and synthesis from works of literature, this paper recommends some of the policies to maintain growth and prevent a more severe collapse in the labor market; the government needs to sustain aggregate demand and supply. Also, ensure the supply chain runs well amid various restrictions. Besides, this paper also proposes that the government maximizes alternative budget resources.

Hypotheses are tested using the data obtained from the Research Institute of Economy, Trade, and Industry (RIETI) Japan Industrial Output (JIP) Database 2011 and Japan Statistics Oﬃcial within period 1970 to 2008.

In the midst of the crush of neoliberal labor market flexibility, workers still often performs various street protests. The rising of minimum wage and changes in employment status towards more profitable one, are some workers material benefits gained through their street protest. Moreover, street protest also contributes to the making of collective workers identity. The high intensity of the street actions spawned the backlash from the capital and state. However, this attack rather than weaken the labor movement, instead it has the potential to encourage greater unity needs of the workers. The backlash from the capital and state during growing economic circumstances provide momentum to the emerging needs of modern interest organizations: a labor’ party. The future of the establishment labor’ party will depend on how much effort of the progressive elements in trade union able to leverage on the one hand a growing economy condition, and at the same time politically able to use reprisals of state and capital against their movement to create the need for the formation of an independent labor party for the rank and file workers.",0.2514200773558329,0.2259998153647375,0.2491583037278497,0.2497644250144944,0.1791410128005028,0.2673371774296193,0.2691303119494239,0.2173215757249864,0.2064108980566106,0.2594612703232059,0.2376188916065925,0.2414108730003802,0.2165937199701196,0.2777670146878928,0.2275738022476337,0.2352731187741456,0.2251362572357602,0.3026244173372537,0.1623602452369449,0.2604673328474962,0.2104023866074132,0.2621883413372798,0.2335329287259339,0.2348230548322676,0.2128711787444734,0.5792397226998549,0.2376483301972669,0.209970089714051,0.241253691508886,0.2146589555694142,0.164754389846071,0.2520122420503634,0.3074603630367276,0.2306634590527064,0.1849359904604574

Furthermore, the research method used in this research was based on qualitative approach. Also, informants in this research were members of Regional Wage Council, employers in the industrial sector, and trade unions/labor unions in Bandung Regency and West Bandung Regency. The results of this study showed that power imbalances empirically existed in the setting of minimum wage. These imbalances were due to the issues of representatives, the number of members, information resources, and uncertainty. Moreover, power imbalances in the setting of minimum wage have led to the government’s more dominant role.

On the other hand, they argue that labor mobility has positive effects on rural development. Labor mobility has been seen as a household survival strategy in response to the socio-economic change resulting from inequality of the market expansion. By involving in the urban labor market, especially in informal activities, migrants are able to share the fruits of development which tend to be concentrated in particular regions (urban areas).

In fact, the position of migrant workers should be considered as a primary factor in bilateral relations and trade agreements, notably between Indonesia and Taiwan. The reason is that the influx of migrant workers has undoubtedly given many benefits to both Indonesia and Taiwan governments. The Indonesian government considered that in the midst of insufficient job opportunities, migrant workers working in Taiwan indirectly lowered the unemployment rate. In addition, Indonesia acknowledged the high contribution of migrant workers by remittances to national income. At the same time, Taiwan recognized the importance of Indonesian migrant workers in the national economy, as well as strengthening Taiwan’s second-track diplomacy with Indonesia vis-à-vis China. This article argues the dynamics of Indonesian migrant workers in Taiwan, influenced by two factors: (1) the state dilemma and (2) people’s realities, affecting the international relations between Indonesia and Taiwan.

This study is keen to examine the poverty and digital divide, particularly in urban poor areas. There are two research objectives. Firstly, to examine the digital diffusion and digital literacy within poor urban neighborhoods in the City of Magelang, Central Java, Indonesia. Secondly, to understand the variation of digital diffusion and digital literacy across areas (with different levels of poverty), age groups, genders and occupations. The data is collected from surveys focused on measuring the access to information, digital diffusion and the use of technology among the poor. This study found that there is a digital divide problem among people in urban areas, especially among people with low incomes. Moreover, the diffusion is dominated by certain groups such as younger people and females. Furthermore, digital literacy among the poor is low. The policy implication is to improve access for digital diffusion and provide assistance to improve digital literacy skills.",0.1790803354816648,0.1569340945684038,0.1764405607728821,0.152491037491351,0.315712622272728,0.1847431696575801,0.1458197821393107,0.1643958451682942,0.1246786463297651,0.1724604963539426,0.1502484827398847,0.1594316345885736,0.1352307191932472,0.1725252587349476,0.1547580271538063,0.1599915415688247,0.1790696083843201,0.1879190085415552,0.1176682535213027,0.1984508544295461,0.1634485263913069,0.1701696240510289,0.1557921289295686,0.1521561680584924,0.1907637370563289,0.1929917194539261,0.1827790554303994,0.1526480212188314,0.1993521436978581,0.1625188852514233,0.2198520195094881,0.1691044737281318,0.1690138578911497,0.1552452712261734,0.1555073739113877

This study reveals factors ranging from multiple clusters, such as socioeconomic status, political partisanship, diversity of media exposure, trust in the media, and the digital fluency of the voters. The Gubernatorial Election of DKI Jakarta during 2016-2017 provided a context for examining the correlation between these factors and the (dis)-belief of digital political disinformation among the voters. In the election, the incumbent governor, Basuki Tjahja Purnama, was falsely accused of being a communist, which is still a dirty word in Indonesia, by his opponent. A survey was conducted for this research, collecting completed questionnaires from 191 citizens of DKI Jakarta who had voting rights and could access the online and digital disinformation. The null hypothesis was that socioeconomic status, political partisanship, diversity of media exposure, trust in the media and digital fluency did not influence the citizens’ perceptions towards digital political information. However, the regression analysis found that the null hypothesis should be rejected. Of those predictors, political partisanship had the highest significant correlation with those perceptions.",0.257748311051872,0.2488436992173999,0.2951270837937303,0.2868264945583006,0.239888978937171,0.3025655689298409,0.2742086849107158,0.2685588945992005,0.287802538556592,0.2939070879225107,0.2823175810015496,0.2711057534421482,0.26781322679535,0.2149192120016891,0.2332071605560135,0.33072663072853,0.1997751390265805,0.3731096912086953,0.246683016413964,0.2887358552609941,0.265534326980022,0.2928959416176085,0.2569274581201191,0.2864468008808581,0.2689843128015986,0.2598099234733231,0.3028379156144469,0.2630837882164518,0.2437358207097887,0.1255940309778356,0.3067517613130868,0.2483535725085257,0.3745327863471033,0.2918904355062355,0.2019933058597577

Most people are using social media platforms to express their perspectives. For the first time, this research aimed to analyze the pattern of a social movement that happened during COVID-19 Outbreaks by analyzing the Twitter dataset contains 23,476 tweets worldwide with the #COVID19 hashtag which was obtained from 02 March to 09 April 2020. Social Network Analysis tools are used to understand the pattern of movement. This research concluded that if the Government and Mainstream Media Twitter account triggered the conversation in the social media platform, followed by the activists and celebrities who engage in conversation between their followers, an ordinary person spread the point of view of the Government and Mainstream Media across their conversation network. The COVID-19 hashtag successfully engaged 10 protest clusters, which pushed the people to fight against COVID-19 in their countries, mostly targeting the government-related account. The digital social movement pattern is relatively different from the traditional social movement, even it has the same steps, which emerge, coalesce, bureaucratise, and the movement itself, but it takes place in the Digital Public Sphere without any social or political boundaries. The digital social movement forced the government to implement a better policy to fight the COVID-19 Pandemic, including to close the national border to prevent unnecessary effects of International Migration.",0.2486555711305837,0.1993837170983764,0.238953503408857,0.2614802476308728,0.2519864873225429,0.2517531917563407,0.2323097772469335,0.2494015468283794,0.2182108523545122,0.2463483192443558,0.2418735120998093,0.2485467360823412,0.2236619998831704,0.2297080607815144,0.1887341137350509,0.2626210779712939,0.2603700456854347,0.2973662947291632,0.187086395454382,0.2556993509405662,0.2220237780135399,0.2727194543383103,0.2318599286308217,0.2475159757719018,0.2159696442856332,0.5048241133382183,0.2395871067627615,0.2264581053523582,0.2549280309820343,0.2309017765986306,0.2425046611240192,0.2598654197551776,0.2660501166147511,0.2294610010516475,0.2136855203556308

Based on our study in Yogyakarta, we found a new internet cafe style that we did not find in other cities. This study offers a new understanding of analyzing internet cafes that users not only consume a computer to access the internet, but they “consume” space as well. This study aims to explore that transformation and to reveal the expansion of consumption patterns. This study emphasizes the empirical investigation to gather the data. We conducted qualitative in-depth interviews and observations from January to June 2018. We also examined several previous studies about internet cafes to expose a gap that can be extended in this study. Based on findings, we found that the transformation from warnet was a way to survive amid mobile technology. This transformation gives an implication to the new means of consumption. However, the expansion of consumption patterns can be explored from the consumption of space and digital content. Overall, digital content is the new insight to understand that internet cafes are not only a place to copy contents, but this can be seen as a symbol of empowerment to local users. Therefore, internet cafes can be seen as media-industry bottom lines to promote a culture of resistance to digital content without going to the store or going to the cinema.",0.1724223487813737,0.1740997370203368,0.190406951013074,0.1651296164226483,0.2707684812895959,0.1712599861725501,0.1974829090660877,0.1723268088944691,0.1754190552322243,0.1767671686082025,0.1608648081458407,0.1622168088433984,0.1311123244066578,0.1251781664729248,0.1544394755143049,0.1643905673274754,0.1502676231834013,0.2252718764310443,0.1438676623754313,0.1790141981554781,0.2088966339885396,0.1725458343587176,0.1771361496693922,0.1589830013642753,0.1845924557858931,0.1712385971664889,0.1912871869899367,0.1774577801136547,0.1708199960053212,0.197537266404313,0.1583878662253908,0.1542697767149632,0.1753235776561497,0.1643608297549273,0.1704311112089704

The results, obtained through the literature research method, show that acts of persecution in social media can be caused by the personalization of the web. Social media allows the occurrence of large bubbles (filter bubbles) that make users reject ideologies or other truths. This becomes a revolution of mindset due to the freedom of information. Meanwhile, in the Habermas public sphere concept, which emphasizes the existence of a critical and rational discussion, this phenomenon indicates a shift. The shift that occurs brings about the lifeworld realm as the basis for the formation of the public sphere with its communicative action, again dominated by the system realm that is dominated by capitalist forces through strategic action. Thus, Habermas's initial goal of strengthening civil society's position against the dominance of the system is now changing.",0.235609144983705,0.2284232739570793,0.2631776073867438,0.2444110297294915,0.2408155275471738,0.2525774025231317,0.2195432209285543,0.2581655900788432,0.2569446231581226,0.2437755524489039,0.2189249603279761,0.2324116792664748,0.2169754787559991,0.2468144337985686,0.2355623959464139,0.248379241702735,0.2260938059862534,0.3366143705266447,0.1815593619921949,0.2760206401761618,0.2121410276253444,0.2429480002247925,0.2225305888649487,0.2597181444861014,0.1970486376017038,0.1715411039184748,0.246189978111084,0.2433386787902953,0.214716065121179,0.155786210082719,0.3038002394548858,0.2182706931211958,0.2224880501503313,0.2354249685435436,0.2158496186535387

The objective of this study is to examine how smart disaster responses to natural disasters, specifically the case of tidal flooding in three districts of the city (North Semarang, Genuk, and Tugu) and a district nearby Demak Regency (Sayung). To obtain comprehensive results, this research uses qualitative methods, which data collected through in-depth interviews; Focus Groups Discussion (FGD); observations; and desk studies. This study finds that Millennials’ involvement is very important due to their distance from political interests and innovatively able to offer strategies in reducing the problems caused by tidal floods. The involvement of millennials in disaster management is relevant, given that Semarang will soon enjoy the demographic bonus, i.e. have a significant percentage of its population of productive age.

The concept of digital divide, workforce, regulation, and infrastructure were used to conduct the analysis. This study employed a qualitative research methodology with qualitative data collection techniques through interviews with two officers of the Parking Technical Implementation Unit (TIU) - the Department of Transportation Bandung City Government, 4 parking attendants, and 100 people as the roadside parking users. To enrich the data, observation and study documents were also conducted. The research used a descriptive analysis combined with simple descriptive quantitative data. It is evident from this study that four primary aspects hindered the implementation of the electronic-parking initiative. Those aspects are a large gap in the digital divide, low workforce quality and quantity, the absence of the proper regulations, and futile infrastructure. Adding to these four barriers, we also found other significant aspects: the investment that has not been strategically designed, the lack of leadership, and the low quality of education and marketing. All these three additional aspects also contribute to the failure in meeting the objective of the electronic parking initiative. This finding suggests that any new initiatives in public service provision, mainly using ICT, need to be well communicated and consulted with the implementing units.

24,24,  Women and Hoax News Processing on WhatsApp   ,Hani Noor Ilahi,https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/31865/pdf,"The word hoax became popular with the development of technology that has potentially increased the circulation of hoax news. One of the ways hoax news circulates is through mobile instant messaging applications like WhatsApp, where users can interact directly, or between individuals who are members of a group. In Indonesia, by 2017, WhatsApp was the most used and the longestused mobile instant messaging application, having 35.87 million users. This study focuses on women using WhatsApp, as previous studies have shown that women dominate social media use in Indonesia. Using the elaboration likelihood model, this study aimed to investigate how women process hoax messages about child abduction on WhatsApp. The results of research through interviews and surveys indicate that women tend to process hoax messages about the abduction of children through peripheral lines. The lack of media literacy and the tendency to prioritize the emotional aspects of a story make some women vulnerable to spreading hoaxes through WhatsApp. In this study, the researchers recommend a digital empowerment movement to improve women’s media literacy through an online lecture model on WhatsApp. This program should be professionally managed by experts or academics from relevant fields of study.",0.1434311064876498,0.1544878752896506,0.163292392046257,0.1660466443740375,0.2116973551700709,0.1716350469956854,0.1775443901863294,0.1241352084076037,0.1398487133243539,0.1481750132697016,0.1729098608471279,0.1597622069124052,0.1555806785555605,0.1248265727552113,0.1367085710281796,0.1800093437925719,0.1282403195423447,0.2099928738222818,0.1346966008156939,0.1691403435353266,0.1417636550010753,0.1743702727139155,0.1502120140707069,0.1746348815120459,0.1576609167290777,0.115235262127592,0.1584064017205852,0.2053824659148168,0.1467913809154004,0.1474365296792147,0.1672245487177132,0.1915162670969515,0.1542163498009675,0.14725956826763,0.15438985040902
25,25,  Bridging Indonesia’s Digital Divide: Rural-Urban Linkages?   ,Aulia Hadi,https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/31835/pdf,"While Indonesia is recorded as one of the greatest social media republics in the world, the gap of rural-urban internet access remains a great challenge. As reported in the 2016 Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Indicators, the number of households with internet access in rural areas is nearly half of those in urban areas; 26.3% and 48.5% in a consecutive way. Rather than simply seeing the internet as a medium, this paper discusses the internet as material culture; therefore, it goes beyond the access and focuses on the ways people use the internet to define their culture. From this perspective, this paper draws the two levels of the digital divide of Indonesian rural-urban dwellers. Lack of motivation and limited material access due to social inequality is at the very base of the digital divide. Subsequently, digital skills and usage deepen the digital divide. While splitting people into either rural or urban categories often produces misleading policies, this paper proposes the rural-urban linkages to bridge the digital divide in Indonesia. The rural-urban linkages particularly incorporate the flow of people and information across space as well as the interconnection between sectors, such as agriculture and service.",0.1776016858200258,0.1656000565369534,0.1922749941963849,0.1822519968274583,0.2490348849467054,0.1949034519777216,0.1754310763215994,0.1542419464447151,0.1530379053915136,0.1828364589120544,0.168099291222777,0.185400481087584,0.1470503572176588,0.1500837569808835,0.1405270684791139,0.2137308351729838,0.1703000224196562,0.1909638042545525,0.1312245007105624,0.1987980783322631,0.2276367685700694,0.1975074707093301,0.1857287255477865,0.1873353458043681,0.2075686913417983,0.1616502663934222,0.1787826630636545,0.1676496824337799,0.1932480908015619,0.1975513584919206,0.1763093066275838,0.1001669386523214,0.171784938262601,0.1673288800587851,0.1515550021129795

In Indonesia, the range of COVID-19 is increasingly sporadic, causing mass panic and Indonesia's geographical characteristics, which will be difficult when this spread could not control quickly. Researchers are conducting several studies to overcome this pandemic, including supervision, features, handling, mobility, patient interaction, treatment evaluation, and the biological structure. These studies become data and lead to Big Data. This article explores how to use Big Data analysis to monitor the spread of COVID-19 as a communication process that reflects mediated communication as a form of mobility and spatial relationships in communication practices. The method used in this article is a literature review and uses meta-synthesis techniques as its analysis. The literature sources used are articles in highly reputable international journals. Based on the reports, various ways to monitor the virus's spread, through public video data, GPS, and social media tracking, trace the patient's movement.

The 1998 political reform led to demands for more aspiring and accommodating bureaucratic services being aﬀorded to the public. The political reform brought about bureaucratic reform bearing good governance, wherein one of its forms is the provision of health services through the innovation of an information technology (IT) based service named e-Health. Keeping in mind Indonesia’s characteristics as a developing country, the implementation of IT-based services evokes numerous debates. This study aims to analyze the implementation of e-Health along with the opportunities it has, and the challenges it faces. By using a study case approach on the Surabaya Municipality Health Authority as the initiator and implementer of e-Health, as well as observations and user surveys, the results show that in spite of having been prepared properly with supporting policies, infrastructure, budgeting, dissemination, and operational system, there were still many prevalent obstacles encountered, particularly concerning digital divide, technical diﬃculties, psychological barriers, and cultural issues. Nevertheless, there are numerous opportunities available for refining e-Health implementation, provided there is a political will from the government to improve and enhance the ICT infrastructure, widespread use of mobile devices, involvement of public participation, and equal distribution of service points easily accessible to the public. Strong government commitment also serves as a guarantee for e-Health service program sustainability in Surabaya Municipality.",0.2381366423799623,0.2234633558436816,0.2613596936742843,0.2616123636132577,0.1602767549552456,0.2473858858904275,0.2631051397522503,0.208413012705852,0.2342283469483269,0.2643672611603388,0.2476099063825898,0.2580606804404822,0.2411586759552512,0.2242954824074167,0.234100978081467,0.2472315129714953,0.2289633100410598,0.2702378943821329,0.1592142788067553,0.2442353923964292,0.2084985015298455,0.2612399672666736,0.2431865137771302,0.2595359342233966,0.2286349682062574,0.6435614314859595,0.2618590851372824,0.2057220032568502,0.2224022460975059,0.1794651910031567,0.2766291259187609,0.2768302168139223,0.3767196050941073,0.2342661233569729,0.1883576326997502

Jika bertolak dari tataran diakronis, secara kronologis Indonesia telah mengalami pelbagai macam fase kepemimpinan dan rezim. Ihwal ini dapat menjadi stimulan positif jika masyarakat dapat mengartikulasikan pengalaman bernegaranya dengan tepat. Kontestasi kekuasaan pun tidak dapat terhindarkan, terlebih setiap pemimpin melakukan persaingan dalam memperebutkan kekuasaan. Kontestasi ini tidak hanya merujuk pada tingkat lokal, namun hingga tingkat nasional. Berbagai aspek pun turut menjadi faktor utama dari kontestasi tersebut, seperti tipe kepemimpinan aristokrasi dan demokrasi, hingga perbedaan gender pemimpinnya. Ihwal tersebut turut mengejewantah kan bahwa keteladanan yang didasarkan atas beberapa kontekstual, bersifat pseudo, atau semu. Dalam mengupas ihwal tersebut, telaah yang digunakan merujuk pada pemahaman Barkerakan agen, dan Gramsci akan hegemoni. Tidak hanya itu, Kouzes dan Posner digunakan untuk menilik parameter keteladanan. Asumsi penulis, keteladanan merupakan unsur yang tercipta untuk menghegomoni agen di dalamnya. Bertolak dari mempertanyakan keteladanan, maka pembahasan akan lebih mempertimbangkan aspek agen, hegemoni dan kuasa.

Despite all the costs it brings, however, measures to handle terrorism until the very recent times are less effective. Defensive measures are sometimes oversupplied while more aggressive ones are undersupplied. Both measures fail to reveal the very essential question of terrorism. Therefore, there needs to be an alternative way of looking at terrorism. Here, terrorism can be captured as an institutional problem at both national and international level. In this stance, terrorism can be put into democracy discourse where democracy is assumed to provide both incentive and constraint to terrorism.

The theory assumed that the furture international conflict will not occur between democracies and non-democracies as Democratic Peace Theory proposed, but between established democracies and emerging democracies. The established democracies reluctant to share their power with the emerging democracies on how to manage global order. This reluctancy will lead to political frictions and conflicts among them. In spite of its theoretical breakthrough, this theory suffers of logical inconsistency since it does not distinguish between emerging democracies and emerging powers. Instead of conflict among democracies, this article argues that international conflict in the 21st century will be dominated by asimetrical conflict between nation-states and radical movements, conflict due to information openess, and conflict over natural resources.

In light of mounting animosity against the ""high politics"" of political parties, parliament, and constitution, civil society is perceived as the diagnosis as well as cure for current ills in politics. This led to glorification of civil society as an alternative to conventional practice of politics. However, experience from new democracies suggests that civil society has been increasingly tampered with cranks, extremists, rejectionists, and crooks.

The results of the study indicated that democracy has significant effects on the level of corruption only in the long run. In the long run, the results show that the impact of democracy is significant at a 1% significance level and decreases the amount of corruption in Indonesia. A 1% change in democracy and other factors are considered equal, which will change the corruption level by approximately 0.2%. The results imply that political stability associated with democracy will result in the corruption index. In other words, the results suggest that democracy reduces corruption.

Yusuf, Syafrial Syafrial",https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/37568/pdf,"The change in designation of Bukit Duabelas area into Bukit Duabelas National Park in Jambi province raises a conflict between the national park official who was ruling the zonation system in the national park and the Orang Rimba people who have lived there for many years. The decision of the protected area aims to preserve the life and culture of Orang Rimba. However, zoning rules in the field are interpreted as an effort to limit space and access to the forest resources for Orang Rimba who have traditionally utilized them. This research uses a case study approach to explore the dynamics of conflict on the protected area. The results of the study show that conflicts in national park management are very dynamic because of shifting disagreement about the protection area. The conflicts began with debates about the zoning system which led into the fight for access to the park resources which were contested over the concept of national parks and customary forests. This paper argues the battle over the national park was not only about contested natural resources but also was a fight for authority and power between the state and indigenous people over the concept of park management.",0.2288600711455564,0.18749101323442,0.2199677643353831,0.2067231023388035,0.2357783984447621,0.1985814725446709,0.1982756915534837,0.2384008154368716,0.2123988834011207,0.2212846541052116,0.180674921558359,0.1949813203692701,0.1682374557611254,0.1800724515736885,0.1632970585880896,0.2056538972269743,0.2396281472427746,0.2346025781607251,0.1698058169580186,0.2172262651070056,0.243287425755439,0.2147677917327548,0.2154428294270969,0.2045825824737767,0.2171547153918819,0.1551629969578881,0.1756191379235384,0.1970680313242134,0.2596222344696512,0.1750769636016896,0.1616073903554839,0.2349706405459256,0.1945310026302925,0.2128830623198616,0.204698093611554

A change in external factors, such as pandemics, has challenged politicians and governments at large to be responsive in resolving problems quickly. Generally, recent research focused on reactive policies, disaster mitigation, and medical issues, while discussing government responsiveness in disease prevention is only covered in a few studies. This research uses a comparative qualitative method with an analysis period from December 2019 to the end of May 2020. The data is derived from various secondary information sources, such as research results, news, official reports, or government statements, which are interpreted through a systematic coding process to explain the phenomenon. The primary results showed that government responsiveness determines the success of handling the deadly coronavirus in pre-pandemic and current pandemic situations. A strong political will and leadership style is essential, and a solid bureaucratic apparatus in implementing policies and programs is decisive. As an authoritarian democracy, in collaboration with CDC, Vietnam was able to anticipate before the pandemic spread and succeeded in suppressing the spread after it was detected even though it had issued a blundering policy. Meanwhile, as a democratic country, Indonesia slowly responded to the outbreak by decision making where the pandemic is handled after it is detected and spread to various regions.

This study analyzed 289 articles published between 1970 and 2020 using a bibliometric meta-analysis with HistCite software and a qualitative approach. This study found four primary research streams in PSI literature: (1) nature of public sector innovation; (2) strategy and innovation capacity; (3) adoption and diffusion of innovation; and (4) implementation and impact of innovation. Our analysis also revealed that the strategy and innovation capacity cluster has the fastest growth in publications. While the nature of the PSI stream is the least published research area, leadership, and organizational culture were the highest frequent antecedent and identified impacts in the empirical PSI studies. Finally, we offer 20 future research directions for these four research streams. This study may be the first to use HistCite bibliometric and qualitative analysis to make detailed information about each research stream of PSI literature in the PA discipline by measuring the number of publications over 50 years.

In the video, Jokowi tends to impress himself as a person who has several characters. As the President of Indonesia, Jokowi displays a diligent character. As a political activist, Jokowi reinforces his ideology as a nationalist. As a citizen, Jokowi imitates the figure who adheres to the values of tradition As a man, Jokowi impressed himself as a humanist. Prabowo tends to feature a lavish lifestyle with equestrian sport with a historical background of the descendants of an economic Democrat Prof Sumitro Djojohadikusumo and associates himself like Soekarno.

119,119,  Partisanship in Crisis: Public Response to Covid-19 Pandemic in Indonesia   ,"Arya Budi, Warih Aji Pamungkas",https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/56443/pdf,"Given the fact that in a context of crises, people are concerned with their safety, among other things, partisan response toward policies and public leaders is an intriguing topic. This article examines the extent to which partisanship pertains to the time of the Covid-19 pandemic. We employ natural language processing (NLP) and social network analysis (SNA) on Twitter data to analyse public responses toward prominent political leaders, namely, Indonesian President Joko Widodo (Jokowi) and Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan (Anies), in handling the crisis of the Covid-19 pandemic in Indonesia. We then put the social media analysis in a framework of political partisanship. Our sentiment analysis through NLP across time and categories found that supports and demands towards the two public figures indicate positive and negative partisanship that replicates previous electoral supports. Similarly, our SNA indicates a high polarization rate among the accounts connected with the two leaders in response to the crisis. Extended analysis of the accounts who are at the epicentres of the sentiment conversations, either positive or negative about Jokowi and Anies, reveals that there are connections with their past political support. Though we find negative partisan responses for both leaders, a type of hard-core partisanship has been leveraged for Jokowi but not for Anies. We conclude that electoral polarization contributes to the extent to which partisanship responses circulate in a context of crisis.",0.2492611120655713,0.2442627417414153,0.2762637600967801,0.2986852048079303,0.2558929180654931,0.2942628423027199,0.2950008647401264,0.2923380058543339,0.299255080062153,0.2766593488531461,0.292344926901295,0.2832343394169349,0.2722782026341304,0.2436101503755955,0.2725055343609053,0.2742074974017485,0.2225487069435115,0.3194876444952289,0.1910578837255277,0.2827543531424501,0.2518667943421337,0.2913611828174704,0.265222895681924,0.3024198161301079,0.2343945843327775,0.5128466894023473,0.2952675601448323,0.2410476677436784,0.2476388887249211,0.2237388696971675,0.3399591297847391,0.2318392046414481,0.3472379272576389,0.2715914592463715,0.2059260716999061
120,120,  Political Polarization and Selective Exposure of Social Media Users in Indonesia   ,"Denny Januar Ali, Eriyanto Eriyanto",https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/58199/pdf,"This study is intended to answer the question of how political polarization is related to social media users’ posts about Covid-19. The researchers chose health cases related to Covid-19 instead of political issues (e.g. elections) to prove that this political polarization has spread to many areas. The research also wants to see the relationship between this political polarization and selective exposure. Theories applied in this study are polarization, filter bubble, and selective exposure. The study applied two methods: social media network analysis and content analysis. The network analysis included 82,156 posts, while the content analysis was carried out on 4,050 social media accounts. The research outcome proves the occurrence of political polarization. Social media users were divided into two major groups, namely pro-Jokowi and anti-Jokowi. Each group interacted with fellow users who had the same political choices and shared the same message content. Users with certain political choices tend to receive the same information as their political choices, and ignore information from other political parties. Another interesting finding from this study is how this polarization was sharpened by the use of hashtags. Each party (supporters and oppositions of Jokowi) uses hashtags to create solidarity and mobilization from each supporter. Research also proves the validity of the selective exposure and filter bubble hypothesis in the Indonesian context.",0.2654247855495145,0.2832285814198371,0.3057191055332056,0.2840327681795102,0.3240514797857724,0.3080164752588853,0.2704823233489579,0.2830914134436049,0.3265745057182628,0.2866411187476297,0.2685967925355533,0.2868256967100415,0.2869720299787821,0.2552492467934139,0.2308260725353121,0.2897239004648298,0.2472944004971152,0.37099179679672,0.204486461031273,0.2963800733100748,0.2411496923985188,0.3070716013262276,0.2611550196199195,0.2961425612278853,0.2104413014169921,0.2279883613115891,0.3162824292667795,0.2835377593493818,0.2595602757492516,0.1582222097813028,0.3342664024729854,0.3002972608764547,0.2852454334893797,0.2703761385399465,0.2320735398002977

But this point of view is argued by some authors who think that terrorism differs from radicalism.

Both Australia and Indonesia should be aware of that reality and try to anticipate the consequences by referring to the existing opportunities for good neighbour policy.",0.2585126898856333,0.2073729131181321,0.2243745753923024,0.2142063521606448,0.2062811640624407,0.2117822090432032,0.2092861343805375,0.2353336461756583,0.2421374060764638,0.2249123349828082,0.2050320824547521,0.2050306710507262,0.1889209481669375,0.2247021830261914,0.2165476864987858,0.2951958507990418,0.20885860021756,0.2477698756822156,0.1785711395315745,0.2225136497046151,0.247662374631932,0.2315668870187406,0.2280534447672798,0.2277390734956511,0.2164343309486663,0.151073249144437,0.2101245118770399,0.1944734474437818,0.2170627079924958,0.1722148929097174,0.2244211551020886,0.1796722478714413,0.1773068146622045,0.2070297932400042,0.1847543300922731

A revolution in Tunisia in 2011 became an international issue aft er the revolution spreaded to other states in the region. Aft er Tunisia, protest movements began to ignite in Egypt, Libya, Yemen, and Jordania. This wave of revolution comes into a public discourse: what causes this movement? How could a revolution in one country inspire another revolution in another country? To answer these questions, we analyze the role of social media as a “bridge” to connect activists in the Middle East to make a revolution. We conclude that transnational activism was formed by routine and massive reports from media which explained what hadhappened in the Middle East during the revolution. The reports were followed by a spread of the idea of democracy and civil rights through social media. As a consequence, revolution took place in several othercountries whose socio-cultural tradition are similar to that of Tunisia.",0.2442118671038402,0.2155730756634627,0.2525954298518316,0.2370896056702333,0.2280871042813248,0.2312908825566609,0.2407839609894465,0.2183215096308672,0.233731290499371,0.2512163220747283,0.2439674856174396,0.2312797514028025,0.2166862196366205,0.2088356998813119,0.2188800235216729,0.2417376417745285,0.2412283802669678,0.292489021048647,0.1768447867411608,0.2762412320900461,0.2642432646974507,0.2695394941635843,0.2284271173597629,0.2457297617890937,0.2114439374442559,0.1791906632102373,0.2345516919512165,0.1978136679030771,0.2411241653719298,0.1816665999278841,0.2777886579870734,0.1777982535795756,0.239002002069385,0.2193785611549061,0.2189289479941747

Besides that, there is also observation on state welfare systems and the market worked in Banjar Pakraman community and its interaction. Due to welfare is a complex matter, then this study only focused on the fulfillment of public main necessaries in order to specify the discussion.

The result suggests that community of Banjar Pakraman Batannyuh has a welfare system which was practiced since long time ago. This system is based on Menyama Braya and Suka Duka values, its institutions form of Keliran, Dadia and Sekehe besides through mechanisms of mutual cooperation, arisan, contribution and giving each other. The main principle of this system is even redistribution and balance without differentiating economic status of community, thus it is not pro poor. When public condition is homogenous, this system is effective to bring public welfare into reality. Whereas, with the heterogeneity in community and high discrepancy due to market system inducing makes this system become not effective. Even this system burdens public.

On the other hand, state welfare system also reaches the community life of Banjar Pakraman. This system which derived from state is not replacing welfare system of Banjar Pakraman, but there is a variation on relation patterns, it is depend on the policy. In general, subsidy policy for poor community is ineffective, thus people makes an even redistribution according to main principle of Banjar Pakraman welfare system.

The dynamics of public welfare system in Banjar Pakraman is phenomenon of social changing. This dynamics occurs due to influence from state and free market which got response from Banjar Pakraman community, thus the free market become more dominant. The influence of free market had change public behaviors, thus improve the efficiency and effectiveness of custom activity.",0.2269334397989967,0.232622315697157,0.2562616360432407,0.2243040447296913,0.2576523172574818,0.2461667366598355,0.206690502943388,0.2347996282017007,0.2649601287542917,0.2382804899366485,0.197442476367638,0.2162692809743687,0.1965704987727605,0.1984101090038171,0.2219828334253606,0.2291607723428796,0.2328133908746592,0.2912358534699854,0.1923100298727916,0.2607574524900825,0.2060438813142963,0.2327864333236806,0.2092694129245792,0.2137100673128029,0.20737053553769,0.1195456049435592,0.2387292315045269,0.2046525746036765,0.2083812873615741,0.1521427853912742,0.3059266839885687,0.2368208309298383,0.2587893234115723,0.2263786536213349,0.1871333936328116
